## install.packages("terra", "sdm")
#Terra is doing everything dealing with spatial in R 
#we're going to use some function of terra packages

## sdm = species distribution model
library (sdm) 
library (terra) ##not using quotes because we use packages that are installed thus we dont need quotes

#use data provided by the package 
system.file #general function that is going to catch a name of file in R system
#inside the package there is a folder and inside the folder "external" there's a file called species.shp

system.file("external/species.shp", package="sdm")
file <- system.file("external/species.shp", package="sdm")
## vectors are series of coordinations. we're dealing with point in spaces thus with vectors.
##there's a function in terra to pass from the name to the vector
#example
rana <- vect(file)
# you can see the structure of the file
rana$Occurrence
#the 0 can be a probem because is an uncertain data. but let's take the zero as a real absence

##how to see the data
plot(rana)
plot(rana, cex=0.5) 

##we want to select only presence from our data set
#double equal means equal
## quadratic parentesis is used to select elements
# 

pres <- (rana[rana$Occurrence == 1,])
pres

#exercise: select absence and call them abse

abse$Occurrence
abse <- (rana[ranaOccurrence == 0,])
 #the coma close the query
plot(abse)

#use par to see the two graphics in one row and two colons

#exercise plot presences and absences one beside the other

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(pres)
plot(abse)

#everytime you have graph nulling use dev.off

#exercise: plot abse and pres together with two different colors
plot(pres, col="red")
plot(abse, col="black")

#predictors: environmental variables
#elevation is the name of the file we import

elev <- system.file("external/elevation.asc", package="sdm")

#rasters are images
plot(elev)

points(pres)

elevmap <- rast(elev)
#rast is a function from terra package

elevmap
plot(elevmap)
points(pres, cex=.5)
#most individuals are distributed in the middle elevation

#we can do the same with temperature
#asc is like jpag
temp <- system.file("external/temperature.asc", package="sdm")
temp
tempmap <- rast(temp)
plot(tempmap)


points(pres, cex=.5)
#places with very low temperature which we dont find rana temporaria

 #exercise do the same with vegetation with vegetation.asc
vege <- system.file("external/vegetation.asc", package="sdm")
vege
vegemap <- rast(vege)
plot(vegemap)
points(pres, cex=.5)
#rast function import as a raster (image)
#high vegetation cover is preferred as habit for rana temporaria

 #same with precipitation
 precip <- system.file("external/precipitation.asc", package="sdm")
precip
precipmap <- rast(precip)
plot(precipmap)
points(pres, cex=.5)

#final multiframe
par(mfrow=c(2,2))

#elev
plot <- (elevmap)
points(pres, cex=.5)
#temp
plot(tempmap)
points(pres, cex=.5)

#vege
plot(vegemap)
points(pres, cex=.5)

#precip

#how to use raster data, 
#how to put points on raster data,
