## multivariate analysis
#vegan package from Pierre Legendre , is a community ecology package
#oridation methods is synonimous of mutivariate analysis

#let's work in R with this package
#the dataset is called "dune" : data()

data(dune)
dune #we have the all data in the console
#a matrix of several plots where in the colons we have all the species and several rows with the number of that species
#another manner is concern with function that is called "head" that is going to show the first six rows
head(dune)
#there's the function "tail" with which you can see the end of the matrix


##
#function decorana in the vegan package (detreded corresponence analysis) 
#assig a name
ord <- decorana(dune)
#we can have summary of what happened
ord
#we have lot of numb and data. see the first two axis 
#if we make a sum of al axis we can see the percentage of all the axis each

ldc1 = 3.7004
ldc2 = 3.1166
ldc3 = 1.30055
ldc4 =  1.47888
total = ldc1 + ldc2 + ldc3 + ldc4

#we wanna know the percentage of the rain
pldc1 = ldc1 * 100 / total
pldc2 = ldc2 * 100 / total
plcd3 = ldc3 * 100 / total
pldc4 = ldc4 * 100 / total

pldc1 + pldc2

#final plot
plot (ord)
#the names are the species thus we can see that there are species which love to stay each other
#show the data in a graph help us to understand the correlation between species 
#in graph we can see just two dimension

#species are also related in time
#some of the time is overlapping
#how much different species are overlapping ach other? 
#so we can undertand better how to monitoring and conservate this species

#now we are going to use another package that is overlap
install.packages("overlap")
#new file is coming
