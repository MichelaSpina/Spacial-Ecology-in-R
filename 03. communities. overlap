#we're going to build a graph
#we have installd 
#in time we should use kernel density (amount of times we've seen that species)

#data
data(kerinci)
head(kerinci) #and we can see the first six variable in xone, space and time
the first six lines are related to the tiger

#summary
summary(kerinci)
#we have the count of the different individuals seen by the cameratraps

#moves of an animal in a day
#tiger
#put the name of the dataset kerinci and put the square parentesis
#the coon containing the species should be equal to tiger
#the dollr is linkink
tiger <- kerinci[kerinci$Sps=="tiger",]
tiger

#one important step: the time we are using is linear but this package is working not in linear but in circular time
#we should pass from line to radiant (circular time)
kerinci$time * 2 * pi
#assing the calculation to an object
timeRed <- kerinci$time * 2 * pi

 #we can make plot to see what are the pix in time to see the tiger
plot(tiger$timeRed)

#let's do it with another species
#exercise: select oonly, the data on the macaque individuals

macaque <- kerinci[kerinci$Sps=="macaque",]
#make variable in time with macaque
timemac <- macaque$timeRed
