# 0.3 population ecology 10/10/23
#we are going to deal with density and dispersion
## density = individuals per unit area
## first package is spatstat, we introdue it in R with quotes
library(spatstat)
#the dataset is called bei, composed by huge amount of data.
plot(bei) 
##we can creat a density map
#let's bild the density map, from the point to a density map
#there's a function in spatstat, passing from point to a continuous surface

#the function is called density. we want to assing the function to an object
densitymap <- density(bei)
#i change from points to pixel. pixel are representing the landscape and what compose the image
#if we use the plot function it will simply erase the previous map
#the funtion which s adding and not erasing the previous map is called points
points(bei, cex=.2)
#the maps are overlapped
#avoid maps with blue green and red since daltonic peolple cannot see the difference
#so let's change the color using one function
use quots when you write colors
cl <- colorRampPalette(c("black", "red", "orange", "yelow"))(100)
#otuside of the functions we are using gradient 100 are the number of diferent coors pasing from black to orange to reed to yellow
#now we can plot the density map
plot(densitymap, col=cl)
