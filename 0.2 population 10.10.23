# 0.3 population ecology 10/10/23
#we are going to deal with density and dispersion
## density = individuals per unit area
## first package is spatstat, we introdue it in R with quotes
library(spatstat)
#the dataset is called bei, composed by huge amount of data.
plot(bei) 
##we can creat a density map
#let's bild the density map, from the point to a density map
#there's a function in spatstat, passing from point to a continuous surface

#the function is called density. we want to assing the function to an object
densitymap <- density(bei)
#i change from points to pixel. pixel are representing the landscape and what compose the image
#if we use the plot function it will simply erase the previous map
#the funtion which s adding and not erasing the previous map is called points
points(bei, cex=.2)
#the maps are overlapped
#avoid maps with blue green and red since daltonic peolple cannot see the difference
#so let's change the color using one function
use quots when you write colors
cl <- colorRampPalette(c("black", "red", "orange", "yelow"))(100)
#otuside of the functions we are using gradient 100 are the number of diferent coors pasing from black to orange to reed to yellow
#now we can plot the density map
plot(densitymap, col=cl)

#EXERCISE
#To built a new color palette
cl.ex <- colorRampPalette(c("beige", "aquamarine3", "blueviolet", "darkorange"))(100)
plot(densitymap, col=cl.ex)

#there were additional data inside the spatstat package ex: 
plot(bei.extra)
#we now have density map and additional value 
#we have to variant, one is the elevation the other one is gradiant
#we want to select the first element
elev <- bei.extra[[1]]
plot(elev)
#so we use the forst variable which is the elevation

#the symbol $ 
#bei.extra$lev is another manner to select one, in this way we link the variable


##what we learnt : how to pass from point to cotinuous map, how to use color, how to plot different things together

#multiframe is the totality of the map
#we're going to state that raw=1,2 (one rope two color). 


##let's make a multiframe
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(densitymap)
plot(elev)
#what i did was opening mfrow 1.2 and than plot inside the densitymap and the elevation

#if we do one colon and two rows
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(densitymap)
plot(elev)


#exercise
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(bei)
plot(densitymap)
plot(elev)


#first point, second density, third elevation
#the higher elevation of area corrispond to the less density o tree as we can see from the map
#bye <3
#next lecture deal with population with package called "sdm", install plantnet into your phone
