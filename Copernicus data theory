16:31, i'm late but we're talking about copernicus and its data

Copernicus - vegetation - energy - water cycle - cryosphere
VPI - vegetation productivity index -> the higher amount of mass (ex. leaves) the higher amount of energy will be for animals for example
dry matter productivity -> the biomass removing water
DMP 
Burnt area
soil water index more related to soil per se, how much moisture is present in the soil
surface soil moisture

Energy
we're going to measure only lower amount of variables
top of canopy reflectence :how much radiation is reflected by different surface (whatever is on top)
surface albedo amount of light reflected by the surface, elate mainkly to soil. obv related with the previous one.  
land surface temperature measure the temperature of the surface of the planet. not what we feel but the temperature. 

Water cycle
lake surface water temperature (LSWT)
lake water quality related to the amount which is disperded in water 
water bodies make measure of amount of fresh water over the all planet

Cryopsphere
three measure variable
lake ice extent: ice extent in lak. how much ice in respect to water is present
snow cover extent: estimate of the amount of thwe snow in a certain area, quite simple to measure because it's withe
snow water equivalent: not a real vaiable but matemathical tranisition from snow to water
